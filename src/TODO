playtest and balance numbers
potions have different colors
make stats seen only from pick-up range

DONE:
remove armor mechanic(NOT GOOD) remove repair from shop as well
remove bonuses from weapons
separate arcana and potion, make potions stackable

IDEAS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

POTIONS:
hp recovery
+dmg for some time
double speed for some time(you get extra turn)
armor recovery(do not make a potion like this, should be a unique shop feature)
hp buffer(like a magic shield)

ITEM STATS:
+-hp
+-dmg
+-armor

item stats:
good stats
lots of good stats + negative stats

special stats:
magic armor = doesn't break but reduces damage, very low reduction something like 1 only
increase effect of healing items

also add bonuses to weapons


DUDE TYPES:
dude that shoots you if you're perpendicular to it
dude that doesn't move and attacks when you come near
dude that is a ghost and slowly moves towards you, hitting you

SHOP
break down weapons into materials, use materials at a blacksmith

NOTES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BONUS STATS
have total stat weight so that (2weight = 1dmg/1hp or 0dmg/2hp or 3dmg/-1hp) 
statted items generally have less armor
at low stat weights stuff like 5dmg/-4hp is not possible, limit really high imbalance
so it's like:
stat weight = f(card_level)
max imbalance = f(card_level)
stats = f(stat weight, max_imbalance)

WEAPON SLOT
currently only one weapon can be in inventory at a time
this makes a possible situation where you have a bow, run out of arrows and have no weapon to use
maybe make a specific weapon slot, and allow more weapons to be carried in inventory
but this might be a reasonable tradeoff for how powerful bow is, balance out with more opportunities for weapon replacement

CARD TYPES
to make sure there isn't too many or too little of one card type, keep track of spawned types for past 15 cards
nothing card spawns some walls
dude card spawns some dudes then walls
treasure card spawns treasure then walls


USING ITEMS
click? - confused with drag
press number button - what if too many slots?
drag onto player - might make a mistake
right click - confusing
universal button for potions - there are other items
what about items that don't affect the player directly(bomb) - drag onto player doesn't make sense then


AMOUNT OF COVERED CARDS
there should be upper and lower limit for number of covered cards
something like: min of 30%, max of 70%
min is more important than max
so as player uncovers cards, each card has a timer
when player uncovers too many cards, cards are replaced earlier
when player uncovers cards too slowly, cards are gradually replaced


CARD REMOVAL
remove only cards that are completed and empty, prioritizing older cards, where age is tracked from the moment card is flipped
completed means:
treasure cards: opened chest(not picking up item is okay)
enemy: if enemy is moving, then doesn't matter, if enemy is static, then when all enemies belonging to card are dead
empty means:
no enemies or player, item is ok
